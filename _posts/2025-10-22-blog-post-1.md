Recently, I came across this kaggle dataset for student stress suvery conducted nationwide. There are 20 factors where participants must give a numerical score to rate how prevalent these factors are. This dataset is pretty interesting as stress is something that affects us all, and understanding what factors are correlated with increased stress levels can improve our quality of life.

# Introduction

For this analysis, I will be using a clustering algorithm. Clustering groups the data points together based on a metric. I will be using a clustering algorithm called Hierarchical Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (HDBSCAN). It is a slightly modified version of DBSCAN, density-based clustering algorithm, which groups the data points in clusters of high density. However, the HDBSCAN further sorts these clusters into a hierarchy tree, and extracts only the clusters that are most stable.


# Code

```
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

from sklearn.impute import SimpleImputer
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
from sklearn.decomposition import PCA

import hdbscan
```

# Results

First, we can visualise how the clusters are separated. One way is to perform principal component analysis, and plot the clusters with x and y axes being the two principal components.
