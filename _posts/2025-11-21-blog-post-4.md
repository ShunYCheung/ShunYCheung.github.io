In the field of Gravitational-Wave astronomy, I see a transition from traditional stochastic sampling methods such as Monte Carlo Markov Chains and nested sampling towards something called *normalising flows*. As our inference problems become harder due to the increasing volume of data, we need faster inference methods. In this blog post, we will go through what is a normalising flow and can it solve inference problem that are intractably long for traditional methods. 

# Normalising flows

A normalising flows works by transforming a simple probabilty distribution (usually a Gaussian distribution) into a more complex distribution through a sequence of mappings. Let $$X$$ be a random variable with a known probability density function $$p_X$$. Let $$g$$ be an invertible function that turns $$X$$ into $$Y$$, $$Y=g(X)$$. Using the change of variables formula, one can calculate the the probiblity density function of the random variable $$Y$$

$$\begin{equation}
p_Y(x) = p_X(g^{-1}(x))\left|\text{det}\left(\frac{\partial g^{-1}(x)}{\partial x}\right)\right|
\end{equation}$$

**In progress**
