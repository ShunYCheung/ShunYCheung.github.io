# Introduction

I have used Gaussian process and it being used extensively in fields such as astrophysics. They are very useful and flexible models that can be applied to timeseries data. However, I often find it difficult to explain a Gaussian process (GP) to a non-expert in a short amount of time. While it is easy to use many of the GP libaries available, wrapping you head around the theoretical concepts can be challenging. 

In this blog post, I will give an introduction to Gaussian processes to a non-expert who are interested in learning and using this stastical tool.

# Formulation

The formal definition of a Gaussian process is a model where your data is described by a multivariate Gaussian distribution. We define the mean $\mu(x)$ and the covariance $\Sigma(x, x')$ and write the Gaussian process as
$f(x)~GP(\mu(x), \Sigma(x, x'))$
