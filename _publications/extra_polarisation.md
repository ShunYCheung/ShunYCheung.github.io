title: "A search for extra polarisations using a Gaussian process in Gravitational-Wave Transient Catalogue 3"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/extra_polarisation_paper
excerpt: 'General relativity predicts that gravitational waves are described by two polarisation states: the plus state and cross state. However, alternate theories of gravity allow up to six polarisations. We employ the gravitational-wave null stream, a linear combination of three or more detectors where the  and  signals add to zero, leaving behind noise and potentially gravitational waves in non-standard polarisation states. We develop a Gaussian process model to search for extra polarisations beyond general relativity. Using data from 42 three-detector events from LIGO-Virgo-KAGRAs Third Gravitational-Wave Transient Catalogue, we find no evidence of non-standard polarisations. We set upper limits on the fractional deviation in gravitational-wave strain to be as low as 0.39 at 90% credibility for the event GW190602_175927.'
