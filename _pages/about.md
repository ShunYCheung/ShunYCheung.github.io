I am a third-year PhD student at Monash university, studying gravitational waves. I am a member of LIGO scientific collaboration and Ozgrav. 
 
I enjoy solving problems, usually by exploring data and applying statistical methods to uncover insights. My current research focuses on gravitational-wave memory, tests of general relativity and glitch mitigation in gravitational-wave detectors. 

Beyond my research, I also enjoy exploring interesting problems in other fields. You can find some of these projects in m

If youâ€™d like to get in touch (or even offer me a job!), feel free to contact me via email.
