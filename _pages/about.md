I am a second-year PhD student at Monash university, studying gravitational waves. I am a member of LIGO scientific collaboration and Ozgrav. 

My current research interests are gravitational-wave memory and tests of general relativity.

I am also interested in data analysis techniques, statistics and machine learning.
